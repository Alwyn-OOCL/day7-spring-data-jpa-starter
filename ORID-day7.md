Stunned
- The first systematic learning of JPA, be stunned by its powerful function.
- Different from Mybatis I learned before, using JPA make us focus on business code more by following the agreement instread of write SQL manually.

# I
- Still need deepen understanding of JPA, like cascade operation, by continous practice and design API.

# D
- Read JPA doc [https://springdoc.cn/spring-data-jpa/](https://springdoc.cn/spring-data-jpa/ "https://springdoc.cn/spring-data-jpa/") 
- More JPA pratice in idle time.
